### Hi, I'm Danilo Å indriÄ‡

I've been enjoying web development for the first time ever since I built a backend in PHP for a game that I was working on. It made me fall in love with the language and I never touched game development ever again.
I'm currently looking for a role in full-stack web development, ideally writing Go or PHP on the backend and Vue.js on the front end. I'd especially love to work at a startup on a tight-knit team where I can make an impact quickly. If you're hiring, let's chat!
